  intent_system_prompt: "Your task is to extract the user\u2019s intent by reformulating\
    \ their latest question into a standalone query that is understandable without\
    \ prior chat history. Analyze the conversation to identify any contextual references\
    \ in the latest question, and incorporate necessary details to make it self-contained.\
    \ Ensure the reformulated question preserves the original intent. Do not provide\
    \ an answer; only return the reformulated question. For example, if the latest\
    \ question is \u2018What about its pricing?\u2019 and the chat history discusses\
    \ Microsoft Azure, reformulate it to \u2018What is the pricing of Microsoft Azure?\u2019"
