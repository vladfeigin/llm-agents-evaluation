# Building and Deploying AI Applications on Azure: Overview and Motivation

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build and deploy AI applications using Azure Data and AI services. This project consists of a collection of demos covering topics like natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, and more. Designed as a hands-on learning experience, these demos will help you get started with building and deploying AI applications on Azure.

## Motivation

Modern GenAI-based applications require continuous experimentation and tuning, with multiple components impacting the overall application quality. To optimize such systems, itâ€™s essential to:
- **Run multiple experiments**: Execute and compare results, ideally measuring the impact of each component on application quality.
- **Automate the process in a CI/CD pipeline**: Ensure seamless testing and evaluation within the development lifecycle.
- **Evaluate production quality affordably**: Sample real production data to assess application quality in a feasible way.

An ideal evaluation system should detect changes in individual components, assess their impact, and provide developers with actionable feedback. It can highlight specific areas for improvement, suggesting next steps and even enabling autonomous optimization. However, building such an evaluation system presents a challenge due to the complex, multi-component nature of AI applications.

Consider a simple example of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Although commonly regarded as a single-agent system, RAG comprises multiple interacting components, each functioning as an independent agent or tool.

## RAG System Components

A typical RAG system includes the following components:

- **Data Preparation**
- **Search Engine**
- **Chat Context Management**
- **Language Models**
- **Monitoring**
- **Security**
- **Test Dataset Preparation**
- **Evaluation System**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**

### 1. Data Preparation

Data must be gathered from multiple sources, cleaned, normalized, and stored in the search engine for accurate retrieval.

**Challenges**:
- Handling various data sources and formats (e.g., relational databases, graphs, text, images, audio, video).
- Structuring the data (graph or flat) to optimize search results.
- Ensuring data is fresh and up-to-date in the search engine.

### 2. Search Engine

The search engine should index data, support complex queries, and deliver fast, accurate results at scale.

**Challenges**:
- Choosing the best search engine type (vector, keyword, graph, hybrid).
- Enabling multimodal search, advanced filtering, and reranking.
- Balancing latency and search quality for a hybrid search setup.

### 3. Chat Context Management

The system must retain conversation context, understand user intent, and prepare the next query for the search engine.

### 4. Language Models

Several language models may be used for distinct tasks, such as intent recognition, reranking, and response generation.

**Challenges**:
- Selecting models that balance quality and cost-effectiveness.
- Ensuring model performance without compromising quality.

### 5. Monitoring

Monitoring is crucial to track system quality, detect anomalies, and provide developers with actionable feedback.

**Key Aspects**:
- Collecting traces for each component, user interaction, latency, and token usage.
- Real-time quality monitoring and anomaly detection.

### 6. Security

The system should prevent abuse with mechanisms like content filters, rate limiting, and anomaly detection.

**Challenges**:
- Detecting unusual usage patterns or abuse attempts.
- Defining security metrics to measure effectiveness.

### 7. Test Dataset Preparation

Preparing a reliable test dataset is essential for evaluating system quality.

**Key Considerations**:
- Reflecting real-world scenarios to accurately assess quality.
- Continuously updating the dataset based on real production interactions.

### 8. Evaluation System

The evaluation system measures overall system quality using metrics relevant to each component.

**Challenges**:
- Identifying and tracking suitable metrics for comprehensive evaluation.
- Integrating multiple metrics to assess system quality holistically.

### 9. CI/CD Pipeline

Automating evaluation in a CI/CD pipeline ensures quality checks during each deployment.

**Suggestions**:
- Define checkpoints for evaluation metrics throughout CI/CD stages.
- Automate evaluation for streamlined testing and validation.

## Development Lifecycle (DLC) for AI Systems

Developing complex AI systems may require a modified approach compared to traditional software.

**Key Questions**:
- Is there a unique development lifecycle required for GenAI systems?
- Can these systems adopt a multi-service/microservice architecture?
- How should the architecture support experimentation and quality measurement?

---

### Tracing and Logging

Effective tracing is essential for maintaining system quality. Traces should capture:

- User interactions, latency, and token usage.
- Centralized logs for real-time and historical analysis.
- Implement centralized logging with an analytics and a visualization tool for insights.
- Maintain consistent trace granularity across components.
- Collect traces in a central location for real-time and offline analysis.

## Summary

The project provides a modular approach to building GenAI applications on Azure, emphasizing experimentation, monitoring, and evaluation. With structured workflows, effective evaluation systems, and CI/CD integration, developers can build high-quality, adaptable AI applications.

### Goals

1. **Enhanced Evaluation**: Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to identify areas for improvement.
2. **Adaptive CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate the evaluation framework into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous feedback.
3. **Scalable Tracing and Monitoring**: Implement a scalable tracing system to support real-time monitoring and historical analysis.

**TODO:**

- **Detailed Descriptions**: Add further technical details or examples for each component.
- **Visual Diagrams**: Include system architecture, data flow, or CI/CD integration diagrams.
- **Benchmark Metrics**: List benchmarking metrics to evaluate component and system performance.
